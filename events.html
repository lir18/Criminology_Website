  <p>The Murder Mysteries are one of our best events. Come dress up, act or be a
  detective in one of murders ! Each Murder Mystery is different, and who knows,
you might be sitting just next to the murderer ! Our murder mysteries are themed,
such as 1920s mobsters, Christmas, Wedding etc, so there will always one you will
like to come to! The event starts at 7 P.M down at the Old College in a beautiful
lounge area on a Friday night. Food and drinks are provided so you won't go
hungry. In general, the Murder Mystery finishes at 9 PM and attendees are welcome
 to join us for some drinks in the town and party. You can either be one of the
  actors, i.e. one of the suspects (you might be the murderer!) and your entry
  is free ! Or you can come as one of the detectives. The detectives need to ask
   the suspects questions and find clues in order to find out who is the killer.
  Detectives need to contribute 2£ to the event. But don't worry, that money
   will be going for charity. In our last Murder Mystery, we raised over 40
   pounds for the Marie Curie charity !
</p>
<p> So not only will you be having an amazing time, but you will also be fed and
   contribute to charity ! What is there not to like? You can also invite people
   who are not part of the Society for the event, we don't mind.
 </p>

<p> We might be an academic society, but don't you worry, if you like sport or
   want that extra motivation to go work out, we're here for you ! So far, the
     Criminology has participated in the annual Super Teams and we hope to take
     home first place next time ! The Society is also going to be participating
     in the Aber7! We are also going to be organising football and basketball
     sessions for those of you who just want to burn steam off and have a laugh.
     A lot of the members have a gym membership, so if you need a gym buddy,
     why not ask someone in the society to join you?
   </p>
<p> When the weather starts getting better, we are also hoping in doing regular
  hikes on the weekend, so that we can all stay fit, watch the beautiful Welsh
  landscape and take amazing photos. We will also be taking advantage of our
   wonderful beach and organise water gun fights when it gets really hot! We
   all know how hot Aberystwth can be in May! </p>
