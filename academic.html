  <h1> The Society here to help you do your best academicaly! </h1>
  <p>The Criminology Society was created by students who wanted to share, help
    and have fun with other students from Aber. As the stats prove, we do great
    work and love to have good grades, so it is only normal for the society to
    have Criminology Talk Session, Study groups and exam revision sessions!</p>
