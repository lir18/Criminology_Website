  <h1> The Society here to help you do your best academicaly! </h1>
  <p>The Criminology Society was created by students who wanted to share, help
    and have fun with other students from Aber. As the stats prove, we do great
    work and love to have good grades, so it is only normal for the society to
    have Criminology Talk Session, Study groups and exam revision sessions!</p>

  <p>Your secretary regulary does Criminology Talks in the Study group 1 in the
    Thomas Parry Library. Here, students from different parts of the world will
    share their views on prisons, the death penalty, and criminality in
    general. this will help you get inside knowledge on all these topics and
    might help you for assignments and your dissertation. It's also a great way
    to meet new people and find like minded friends </p>
