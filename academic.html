  <h1> The Society here to help you do your best academicaly! </h1>

  <p>The Criminology Society was created by students who wanted to share, help
    and have fun with other students from Aber. As the stats prove, we do great
    work and love to have good grades, so it is only normal for the society to
    have Criminology Talk Session, Study groups and exam revision sessions!</p>

  <p>Your secretary regulary does Criminology Talks in the Study group 1 in the
    Thomas Parry Library. Here, students from different parts of the world will
    share their views on prisons, the death penalty, and criminality in
    general. this will help you get inside knowledge on all these topics and
    might help you for assignments and your dissertation. It's also a great way
    to meet new people and find like minded friends </p>

    <p>You will also get information about the SSCC meetings and other academics
      concerns here. Thankfully, your academic representatives are also very
      involved in the Society, so communications is optimal ! If you have any
      concerns about the uni, please drop an e-mail to your academic rep. You
      can find their contact information on your student record page !</p>
      <p> Here is the latest SSCC meeting notes ! The notes content information
        about the strikes, and modules, so please check it out ! </p>


        <h1>SSCC Meeting Number 2: 21st of February 2018 , at 14:10 in EM 2.50</h1>


<h3>Llyod :</h3>
<p>Usual items about library:
Taken part in few classes (especially first year) which helped to evaluate
sources, saw a number of dissertation students (second and third year) for help
 on different resources searches, methods etc.
Wouldn’t mind making groups to help people with their diss.
Cost of photocopying has been reduced to 2p.
The library catalogue sends out a automatic email to remind people what we have
on loan. So it’s easier to track what you have let out.
Don’t be scared to contact Lloyd, in person or by e-mail.</p>

<h3>1/Discussing about the minutes Ann Sherlock: </h3>
<p>Strike action: 50% turnout and a national strike action by University staff.
Reasons behind this strike is because of how the universities and government are
 cutting staff’s pensions by a very significant amount (10 000£ a year in
 retirement). It will affect younger members of staff than older staff. Might
  also stop young people to get into higher education jobs. First time that
  Aber Uni prof. have taken strike action. The Union’s position is that classes
   should not be rescheduled. University is hoping to put pressure on lecturers
    to reschedule otherwise they will dock even more of their pay.
Will attendance be affected? the answer is: don’t know, but it might be more
likely that people who don’t scan might be noted as absent by the scanning
system.  But management might be able to put a “non-recorded class”.  Might be
 a good idea to go on tell us now. It might be a good idea for students to tell
  about the frustration about the outcome of the strike so there is a proper
   affect. Need to explain that exams are at risk of being without the content
    student need, so student NEED TO VOICE THEIR CONCERN in support of the strike. </p>

<h3>What is your position on the petition against being refunded? Do you think
   that it will happen? How will exams be affected?</h3>
<p>Best way it to go is through the Student Union.  However, conversation with
   academic officer has said to support strike but not money petition.
Hopefully, the strike will not go out so long, hopefully, students can manage
 to convince management to not cut pensions. Unless you do feel worried and
  frustrated, there is no incentive for management to do anything about it.
  Lecturers are feeling terribly guilty about it. Their management are not
  protecting them, so they are hoping students will step in.
<h3>Will you be giving notice?If the negotiations start? Will you stop striking?</h3>
<p>Not necessarily, the Union does not want the lecturers to tell, there is no
   obligation, but some staff have notified their students (but not management).
It depends on how negotiations go, if they collapse, they will have to go back on the strike.</p>

<h3>Chair: Lois Nash:
2/Response from last meeting: </h3>
<p>Some problems have been resolved, however, for the European law seminar
  problem was not resolved. Suggestion by 2nd Year Law rep would be to limit
  the amount of people can go to a seminar (so even if you have missed your
  seminar, cannot go to another seminar if it is overcrowded). Answer by the
  committee said that the expected norm in the UK and Eu is to have 20 to 30
  people per seminar, so it does not defeat the purpose of the seminar.</p>
<h3>3/Matters of concern in relation to schemes and modules
Manon and Alex: Personal tutor problem. </h3>
<p>Allocations have been allocated to the wrong people
People who had Richard as a personal tutor were not told who would have been
replaced. They are now replaced, but not with the expected notice.
 For example the Land law seminars, the Seminar tutor does not like land
 law, doesn’t understand it and doesn’t
 give appropriate seminars (answers: “I don’t know, google it”). Students wonder
  way has she been selected as seminar tutor, despite the fact that another PhD
   student loves it and could be the one teaching it.
Committee will try and rectify the issue. One way you could deal with it is to
“nicely” raise it with you tutor. Brendan says might be a good thing to do peer
 reviews (where one staff member looks over the seminar/lecture to evaluate and
  give objective feedback). </p>

<h3>4/Employability update</h3>
<p>Uta: We used to run “employability talk” that would be coming in weekly,
  alumni and relevant people. These talks don’t longer happen because there is
  no more budget and the fact that sessions are poorly attended. We feel it is
unfair, and it should be good for the institute to put money aside so that we
can have talks with our students. Ffion is hoping to have talks where they will
not have to travel over (maybe skype talks?)
Tony: It is a long way to come for employers to come, and when people don’t
turn up, it does put employers off and alumni. So if we want more people to
come, we need for students to be more proactive so that more people are likely to come.
Tony has put pop up schedules career guidance and sessions. List about
 e-mentoring (to match with alumni in a particular industry) and is trying to
 get more employers over.We Could put a scheduled lecture on students time table
  (which will be optional, like miscellaneous lectures) so there is more
   availability. Might be good to do an RVSP. </p>

<h4>5/Student representation</h4>
<p>Encourage people to run for the next set of election (the big SU ones) and
  for next year.
We now have 1st year Criminology representatives now !!!
Nicola nam18@aber.ac.uk : post graduation rep, please don’t mind messaging me,
 and respond to email for project. </p>
<h3>6/Enhancement of learning opportunities</h3>
<p>Turnitin has a highlighter to highlight problems. It is a lot better for
  students to be able to see their mistakes instead of having a long paragraph
   at the top of the paper explaining it, as it does not help visualise the
    problems. Students would like to know “what, why and how is it not relevant”.
Committee cannot make standardised feedback as it is not taking into account
 the individuality of lecturers. However, staff are more than likely to give
 more feedback if students ask by email or just visit.</p>

<p>Exam feedback: Tutor are only inviting people to see their exam papers;
  however, many people would like to talk with the people who have corrected
   and understand in a less intimidating way their marks and paper.
The marker, should be able to make feedback sessions after the assignment has
been done. Personal tutor is supposed to look at both exam and assignment. If
 tutor can’t help, would be good to refer to the person who is more
 knowledgeable on the subject.
For extra feedback, go to office hours and have a chat.
Personal tutor sessions need to be attended by all, because most of the people
who do need feedback and talking with tutor are not actual going to their meetings.
Problem with lecturers pointing out spelling mistakes and makes a typo whilst
 saying this. Brendan explains that different browsers does certain typos or
 autocorrect or does not show spelling mistakes. Not intentional. </p>
